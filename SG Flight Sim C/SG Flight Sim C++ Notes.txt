Allow for module damage at less than 25% shields
	chance?
if module is hit, have chance to damage or destroy it
aoe explosion if reactor is hit and offlined
	cause hp and module damage
external aoe damage only affects external modules
	turrets
	sublights
	manuvering thrusters
	long range sensors
	short range sensors
	subspace beacon
add a hyperspace chargeup delay
	add into module stats?
missile AI
	missile travels 200m forward, then turns at a constant set turning speed to point at target. detonates on impact with something or runs out of fuel
asteroids have static positions and respawn randomly after awhile
have a cargohold
damaged or destroyed t1 modules can be repaired with the parts that are needed to build them
	t2 modules have to be repaired (if damaged) or replaced (if offlined) at a station? or they can be replaced on the ship
manufacturing on stations and special industry ships
when you enter the atmosphere of a planet, you leave the solar system grid and enter the planet grid at a certain spot, happens again when you leave
Asteroids were classified with the Thalen Classification system
each module gives you ship its stats (with the exception of fighters)
s, m, and l modules
need the reactor to be online for anything to run
module stats can be modified as a tradeoff system
subclasses to t1 module tier
Rotation equation: t=I*< I=mr^2 t/I=< F/(m*r)=<
	t=Torque
	I=Rotational Inertia
	<=Angular Acceleration (rad/s^2)
	F=Force (N)
	m=Mass (kg)
	r=Radius (M, half of ship length)
t1 items are made parts
parts are made from asteroid minerals
t2 items are made from adding alloys to the t1 version
when a mod is damaged, 40-60% of the parts are destroyed and can be replaced to repair it
when a mod is destroyed, 80-90% of the parts are destroyed and can be replaced to repair it
you can salvage modules to gain their parts
	makes them damaged or offline
armor adds hull hp's but increases the ships mass
Refine ore in batches of 200
roid size is by units of minerals
	XS: 1,000-10,000
	S: 10,000-100,000
	M: 100,000-1,000,000
	L: 1,000,000-10,000,000
	XL: >10,000,000
asteroids of any type can be any size, but the defined asteriod size is only the most common size
one unit of ore is 1m3, then there are different densities of minerals
armor be like, 100mm/300mm/500mm

Warp gates within a solar system???
some ships have a special slot for a special mod (i.e. cloak)
'dual' class turrets have an auto-tracking feature on the target that they are assigned to
	groupings and fire control?
turrets
	railguns
		long range
		slow rmp
		fast projectile speed
		some cap usage
	cannons
		short range
		fast rmp
		medium projectile speed

	needs targeting
	most are shorter range, but have some long range cruise missiles
aoe weapon?
	em burst to disrupt targeting and all modules
	explosive damage from ships being destroyed
	mines?
ammo racks are linked to specific weapon mount locations, if they are damaged, then there is a slower reload rate. if they are offline, then the linked weapons cant fire
ammo
	Railguns
		Iron Sabot
			Weak
			shorter range
		Iridium Sabot

t2 ammo can only be used in t2 guns
laser ammo lasts 100 shots
mining
	High powered, focused lasers are shot at asteroids. the asteroids loose hp's, and as they do, rock fragments of the appropriate size fall off into space. then
	they either need to be manually collected, or they can be brought to you with tractor beams and then collected
large ships will be about 15% air
special mod ideas

			done procedurally, like, one ammo/time
	life support
		can either improve, be neutral, or hinder the performance of the crew*
	cloak*
		makes ship invisable
Mass and inertial dampeners affect turning abilities and acceleration
crew ideas
	affect auto-tracking turrets
	affect repair times
	affect ammo rack reload times
	affect ammo reload times
hyperdrive speed affected by mass, median mass for the ship class has a multiplier of 1, if above, the mass is less, the multiplier goes between 1 and 2, or 
if above, between 0 and 1
ships can fit modules of their class size or smaller
ships (that have an armor slot) can fit armor plates
ship shuts down when reactor is offline and the capacitor is empty
module measurements are taken from the center
cap cost to opening a hyperspace corridor
cap cost to using propulsion
SR sensors only work in line of sight
	time delay before disengaging lock
have a variable check, only go onto the next tick when all threads have finished, timed??
sublights and manuvering thrusters use consistant, small amount of cap
weapon mounts are locations for turrets, add to CAD models
can only deploy structures in solar systems
NPC's only spawn in solar systems
AI IDEAS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
project a players future actions and fly to that non-existant point
hide in asteroids
	asteroids and other large structures to hide in?
target ships near its class
stay on current target if it will die soon, then switch to a better target
	have a threat assessment, if the threat is too bad, then switch targets sooner, if it isnt bad, then just ignore
threat assessment: 0=No modifier, 1=VL, 2=L, 3=M, 4=H, 5=VH
	target size relative to itself
		<-3 class = 1
		-2 class = 2
		-1 class = 3
		same class = 4
		+1 class = 5
		+2 class = 3
		>3 Class = 2
		other class = 1
	weapons
		dual turrets against smaller ships
			Enemy turrets:
			<-3 class = 3
			-2 class = 2
			-1 class = 1
			same class = 0
			+1 class = 2
			+2 class = 4
			>3 class = 3
		number of weapon mounts (Number of mounts is the threat number)
	distance
		0-50km = 5
		51-100km = 4
		101-500km = 3
		501-2000km = 2
		2001-10000km = 1
		>10000km = Threat is zero unless special

SR sensor anomalies: 1=VL, 2=L, 3=M, 4=H, 5=VH
when AI detect a SR sensor anomaly, they will attempt to jump to it, they are more accurate with their jump estimate the stronger the threat level is and the closer
the signal is, once they jump, they will burn their way towards the signal
	mining laser use (once laser is turned off, the threat effect lasts for 1 minute)
		S = 1
		M = 2
		L = 3
	weapons fire (Once weapon ceases firing, the threat level lasts 2 minutes
		S = 2
		M = 3
		L = 4
	explosions (threat level is based on explosion radius)
		<5m = 1
		6-15 = 2
		16-30m = 3
		31-50m = 4
		>50 = 5
	subspace beacon
		5

broadcast targets for collaboration
protected mining operations
have AI utilize SR sensors for damaging modules
PROCEDURAL GENERATION--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary generation: Generating the basic set of stars
Secondary generation: Generating large galactic structures
Tertiary generation: Generation of things in solar systems as needed, not permanent*
Galactic:
	Primary
		Have the XZ coords of star systems only occurr on sums that equal prime numbers	9,592 * 4 = 38,368
		Have the Y coord of star systems only occurr on prime numbers			669 * 2 = 1,338		38,368 * 1,338 = 51,336,384
	Secondary	
		Add in star clusters after primary generation, delete stars in the radius area then generates a higher volume of stars
		Add in nebule?
Stellar (Tertiary):
	Have the star types be randomly generated, this type then affects the solar system attributes in a controlled-random manner
	Planets and their moons generate based on controlled-random factors
	Structures and stations generate randomly
	Asteroids spawn properly, but composition is based ont he star metal amount

Galactic coordinates:
	Sun to the left of the buldge, looking down, XY is normal, then +Z is above the plane, and -Z is below the plane

Local accurate cluster (Use this for beginning game?) Add in earth as the starting system along with the local stars, earth is at (-27,000,0,0) (38 stars plus the sun)
